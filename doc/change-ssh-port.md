How to configure the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) and change the SSH port.


### Goals

- Change the SSH port to be something besides the default port 22. This may reduce the number of attempted attacks on your server.

    See: [Should I change the default SSH port on linux servers?](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/32308/should-i-change-the-default-ssh-port-on-linux-servers)


# Steps

1.  Change the SSH port.

    
    While logged in as a user with sudo privileges, change your SSH port from the default 22 to a number in [1025, 65536). Make a note of your new port number, or you will be unable to login after making this change.

    Open the sshd configuration file:
    ```
    sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    ```
    And change the following line to set your new port number:
    ```
    # What ports, IPs and protocols we listen for
    Port {your-new-port-number}
    ```

    Reload the ssh:
    ```
    service ssh restart
    ```

    Now when you try to SSH into the server, you will need to specify the port:
    ```
    ssh {username}@{your-server-ip-address} -i {rsa identity file} -p {your-new-port-number}
    ```

2. Create a temporary backdoor.

    To avoid locking yourself out, first create a temporary backdoor with [your ip address](https://www.whatismyip.com/).
    ```
    sudo ufw allow from {your-ip-address}
    ```

    Later on, you can remove this backdoor by calling `sudo ufw delete allow from {your-ip-address}`.


3. Only allow incoming packets on your SSH port, HTTP (port 80), and NTP (port 123).
    
    Create a new rule allowing incoming tcp and udp packets on each of these ports.
    ```
    sudo ufw allow {your-new-SSH-port-number}
    sudo ufw allow 80
    sudo ufw allow 123
    ```

4. Enable the firewall.

    ```
    sudo ufw enable
    ```

    If you need to disable the firewall at some point, call `sudo ufw disable`.
